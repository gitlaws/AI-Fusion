      <h2>Retrieval-Augmented Generation</h2>
      <p>
        In today's traditional admin panels users often manually navigate
        through complex databases, searching for specific information.
        Implementing RAG enables users to effortlessly search through countless
        records, by simply asking the AI assistant, "How many new user accounts
        do we have?" Or, prompt any specific information from internal or
        external databases and the AI will instantly provide accurate responses
        of your company's data sources.
